# Documentation Audit Report
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Branch:** `docs/update-documentation-accuracy`

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of all documentation revealed **3 critical inaccuracies** across 7 files that contradict the current codebase implementation.

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **WRONG Production Firebase Project ID** - Multiple files reference `backdrop-fm` instead of correct `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e`
2. **WRONG Collection Naming Strategy** - Documentation claims environments use different collection prefixes (`dev_videos`, `staging_artists`) when codebase uses NO prefixes
3. **OUTDATED Configuration Mechanism** - Firebase setup docs describe iOS schemes/Android flavors when app actually uses VS Code tasks

---

## Status: In Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] README.md - Updated all production project references and collection naming section

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md - Large file requiring major rewrite of collection naming section

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md - Needs complete rewrite to reflect VS Code task approach
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT.md - Update production project references
- [ ] GIT_WORKFLOW.md - Update pre-commit hook description
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md - Update branch strategy and pre-commit hook
- [ ] GIT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md - Update pre-commit hook description

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. README.md ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Changes Made:
- ‚úÖ Fixed production project: `backdrop-fm` ‚Üí `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e` (7 locations)
- ‚úÖ Rewrote "Firestore Collections" section to reflect unified collection naming
- ‚úÖ Updated seed script note to remove "collection prefix" reference
- ‚úÖ Fixed all Firebase console URLs
- ‚úÖ Fixed all deployment commands
- ‚úÖ Fixed all seed commands

---

### 2. ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - NEEDS MAJOR UPDATES

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
**Size:** 507 lines
**Status:** Not started

#### Critical Section: Collection Naming (Lines 79-98)

**CURRENT (COMPLETELY WRONG):**
```markdown
### 3. Collection Naming

Each environment uses different Firestore collection prefixes:

| Environment | Videos | Artists | Users | Playlists |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Development | `dev_videos` | `dev_artists` | `dev_users` | `dev_playlists` |
| Staging | `staging_videos` | `staging_artists` | `staging_users` | `staging_playlists` |
| Production | `videos` | `artists` | `users` | `playlists` |
```

**VERIFIED IN CODE:**
`/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/lib/config/environment.dart` lines 94-98:
```dart
static String getCollectionName(String baseName) {
  return baseName; // NO PREFIXES
}
```

**MUST BE REPLACED WITH:**
```markdown
### 3. Collection Naming

**All environments use the same collection names** for consistent code:
- `videos`
- `artists`
- `users`
- `playlists`
- `mailingList`

**Environment isolation** is achieved through separate Firebase projects, not collection prefixes.

**Test data convention:** Document IDs use `dev_` prefix (e.g., `dev_video_001`) to distinguish seeded test data from real user-generated content.
```

#### Other Issues in ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md:
- Lines 302-323: Firestore Security Rules section describes separate rules for `dev_*`, `staging_*` collections (WRONG)
- Lines 13, 148, 227, 246, 248, 257, 269, 492, 501: References to `backdrop-fm` should be `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e`
- Missing section on VS Code tasks being the configuration mechanism

---

### 3. docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - NEEDS COMPLETE REWRITE

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md`
**Status:** Not started

#### Major Issues:

**Issue 1: Outdated Configuration Approach (Lines 41-58)**

Document describes iOS schemes and Android flavors selecting Firebase configs. This is WRONG.

**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- VS Code tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`) copy environment-specific Firebase configs
- Launch configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`) trigger pre-launch tasks
- Works across all platforms without platform-specific build configuration

**Needs:** Complete rewrite of sections:
- "Launch Configurations" (lines 41-46)
- "Build Flavors" (lines 48-58)

**Issue 2: Production Project ID**
Line 46 references `backdrp-fm-prod` should be `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e`

**Issue 3: Missing VS Code Task Documentation**
No explanation of how VS Code tasks work or why this approach is used.

---

### 4. DEVELOPMENT.md ‚è≥ PENDING

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/DEVELOPMENT.md`
**Status:** Not started

#### Issues:

**Line 44:** Production project reference
```markdown
# CURRENT:
| Production | `backdrp-fm-prod` | Live production data |

# SHOULD BE:
| Production | `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e` | Live production data |
```

**Line 76:** Console link
```markdown
# CURRENT:
- [Production Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/backdrp-fm-prod)

# SHOULD BE:
- [Production Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/backdrp-fm-prod-4215e)
```

**Lines 46-55:** Collection structure needs emphasis added
```markdown
# ADD EMPHASIS:
**Environment isolation is achieved via separate Firebase projects**, not collection naming.
```

---

### 5. GIT_WORKFLOW.md ‚è≥ PENDING

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
**Status:** Not started

#### Issue: Pre-commit Hook Description (Lines 258-267)

**CURRENT (Incomplete):**
```markdown
### Pre-commit Hook
Automatically runs before each commit:
- ‚úÖ Flutter analyze
- ‚úÖ Code formatting check
- ‚úÖ Unit tests
- ‚úÖ Debug statement detection
- ‚úÖ Sensitive file protection
```

**SHOULD ADD:**
```markdown
- ‚úÖ **BLOCKS commits to main branch** (exit code 1, not just warning)
```

---

### 6. CONTRIBUTING.md ‚è≥ PENDING

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/CONTRIBUTING.md`
**Status:** Not started

#### Issue 1: Branch Strategy (Lines 69-77)

**CURRENT:**
```markdown
We use a feature branch workflow:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
```

**SHOULD BE:**
```markdown
We follow GitHub Flow:
- `main` - Production-ready code (protected)
- `feature/*` - New features (branch from main)
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes (branch from main)
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes (branch from main)

Note: We do NOT use a separate `develop` branch.
```

#### Issue 2: Pre-commit Hook (Lines 160-165)

**ADD:**
```markdown
# - **BLOCK commits to main branch** (not just warn)
```

---

### 7. GIT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md ‚è≥ PENDING

**Location:** `/Users/aaronwickham/development/projects/backdrp_fm/GIT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
**Status:** Not started

#### Issue: Pre-commit Hook Description (Lines 16-22)

**CURRENT:**
```markdown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns about TODOs and main branch commits
```

**SHOULD BE:**
```markdown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns about TODOs
- ‚ùå **BLOCKS commits to main branch** (exit code 1)
```

## Missing Documentation

### 1. VS Code Configuration Guide üìÑ TO CREATE

**Suggested Path:** `docs/VSCODE_CONFIGURATION.md`

**Purpose:** Explain how VS Code tasks and launch configurations work together to manage multi-environment Firebase setup.

**Should Include:**
- How pre-launch tasks work
- Why VS Code tasks approach was chosen (cross-platform compatibility)
- How Firebase config files are copied
- How to add new environments
- Troubleshooting VS Code issues

### 2. Database Conventions Guide üìÑ TO CREATE

**Suggested Path:** `docs/DATABASE_CONVENTIONS.md`

**Purpose:** Clarify unified collection strategy and test data conventions.

**Should Include:**
- Why all environments use same collection names
- Test data document ID conventions (`dev_` prefix)
- Security rule implications
- Firestore indexes
- Migration notes (if old prefix approach was ever used)

---

## Files to Consider Deleting/Consolidating

No files should be deleted, but consider consolidating:
- `QUICK_START_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` ‚Üí merge into `INTEGRATION_TEST_SETUP.md`
- `GIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` ‚Üí merge into `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` as appendix
- `GIT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` ‚Üí archive after initial setup

---

## Verification Checklist

Use this to verify documentation against codebase:

### Collection Naming ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- [ ] Check `lib/config/environment.dart` line 94-98
- [ ] Confirms: `getCollectionName()` returns `baseName` with NO prefixes
- [ ] All environments use: `videos`, `artists`, `users`, `playlists`

### Production Project ID ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- [ ] Check `android/app/google-services.json` line 4
- [ ] Check `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` line 14
- [ ] Confirms: `backdrp-fm-prod-4215e` (NOT `backdrop-fm` or `backdrp-fm-prod`)

### VS Code Tasks ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- [ ] Check `.vscode/tasks.json` exists with copy commands
- [ ] Check `.vscode/launch.json` has `preLaunchTask` fields
- [ ] Confirms: Tasks copy Firebase configs before launch

### Pre-commit Hook ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- [ ] Check `.git/hooks/pre-commit` lines 73-80
- [ ] Confirms: `exit 1` when branch is main (BLOCKS, not warns)
